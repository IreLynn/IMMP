Introduction
--------------
IMMP is web interface designed to allow for simple tagging of geological data in photographs. IMMP allows geologists to quickly tag scanned data to image representations of what they have scanned, creating permanent links between the collected information and the visual representations. 

IMMP is built on Flask, a Python web framework. Many open source technologies are used throughout IMMP's codebase, including [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [ImageMapster](http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/), and [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).
